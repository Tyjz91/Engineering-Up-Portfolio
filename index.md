# Adruino RC Car 
For my First project i created an Arduino RC Car, which is controlled by a remote. This took me about 4 days to build.

# Final Milestone

My final milestone, I've come a long way from where I started just a couple of months ago and have added a lot to my project. I've stripped away a lot of the parts that were originally on the robot to create room for my kicking arm. I changed the code a lot to accommodate the second H-Bridge which I go more in-depth about in my video below. I've loved this journey so far and I can't wait to see where this takes me in my future career.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was being able to first build the Adruino car, then, be learn how to code using Arduino IDE, connecting it to the car and then allowing the car to move with the remote. I also have enough knowledge to be able to talk about in detail what the IR receiver is and how it works.
