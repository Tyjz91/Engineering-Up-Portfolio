# Final Milestone

My final milestone I've come a long way from where I started just a couple of months ago and have added a lot to my project. I've stripped away a lot of the parts that were originally on the robot to create room for my kicking arm. I changed the code a lot to accommodate the second H-Bridge which I go more in-depth about in my video below. I've loved this journey so far and I can't wait to see where this takes me in my future career.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to be able to build the rc car and get it to drive by controlling it with a remote. this process took me about 4 days. I show how i did it and explain how it works in the video below.
